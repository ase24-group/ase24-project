The results of 'progressive' and 'bonr' vary depending on the order in which they are called despite
re-initializing the state of the randomizer each time.

No improvements were noticed on the progressive scoring fn by using the complement of the `want_to_exploit_based_on_ruc` value instead 
during progressive score calculation (under the assumption that we should explore more when the rate of change is 
higher). Its performance is still comparable with bonr.
