Contrary to what I was expecting, the weight of the exploitation function does not seem to increase in a monotonous manner with respect to iterations in the SMO.
Instead, the weight appears to decrease or stay constant most of the time. 

The weight of the exploitation function usually stays below 0.3 with the current criteria for updating the weights. 
This could be why the results of our new approach are very similar to the existing bonr approach.
