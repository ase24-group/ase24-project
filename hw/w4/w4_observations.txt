Question 1: Does SMO do better than the random baselines?
Answer 1:
Yes, SMO performs better than random baselines. This is observed by comparing the print statements
#1 (y values of first 6 examples in ROWS) and #2 (y values of first 50 examples in ROWS) that indicate 
random baseline performance, with the print statement #6 (y values of first row in BEST) that indicates 
the performance of SMO for different iterations.

We can observe rows with a high value for Lbs-, and low values for Acc+ and Mpg+ under random baselines 
(print statements #1 and #2) which is the opposite of the kind of values what we are looking for (we need
 rows with low Lbs- and high Acc+ and Mpg+ values). 
eg: [Lbs-: 4422.00, Acc+: 12.50, Mpg+: 10.00].


The results obtained from SMO seem much better in this regard. Although we might not get rows that are 
closest to heaven, they are a lot closer to heaven than the rows observed from random baselines.
i.e., Lbs- values are generally lower, Mpg+ and Acc+ values of rows yielded by SMO are generally higher 
than those given by random baselines.
eg of a row yielded by SMO in auto93.csv: [2125.00, 17.30, 40.00]


Question 2: How many y row evaluations are required for print 3?
Answer 2:
Print 3 statements print the row that is closest to heaven in the dataset. In order to find the row
that is closest to heaven in the dataset, the y values of all the rows in the dataset have to be evaluated
(398 rows have to evaluated in auto93.csv).


Question 3: How does SMO do compared to absolute best?
Answer 3:
SMO does not perform as well as the absolute best. This is because SMO does not take all the rows 
in the dataset into consideration while making its decision, unlike in the case of absolute best. 
Even though the results we obtain through SMO are not the absolute best, the heuristics employed in 
SMO help us pick a choice that is close enough to heaven while ensuring that only the y values of 
a small subset of the dataset are evaluated. This speeds up the decision-making process significantly.

Examples:
Absolute best row in auto93.csv: [2130.00, 24.60, 40.00]
A row yielded by SMO in auto93.csv: [2125.00, 17.30, 40.00]
